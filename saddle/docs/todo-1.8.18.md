# Saddle 1.8.18 — isolated execution and binary-processing plan

> This plan contains **920 individual actions**. It uses 92 unchecked work packages, each with ten ordered actions: **inspect, extract, classify, design, implement, test, boundary-test, review, document, and record**. The ten actions apply to the exact subject named by each work package; a package may be marked complete only after all ten actions have evidence.

## Completion guardrails

| Rule | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Truthfulness | A contract may describe, plan, validate, or invoke isolation. It must not claim to provide a VPS, micro-VM, browser isolation, persistent database, GPU, signing, or a remote service unless the caller supplies and verifies the corresponding adapter. |
| Isolation | Untrusted bytes are never executed by the transport-neutral root. Execution requires a caller-owned isolated-runner adapter and an explicit policy. |
| Storage | Remote storage is durable state, not literal RAM or VRAM. Materialization remains bounded, measurable, and caller-owned. |
| Effects | Network, browser, container, filesystem, database, credentials, dispatch, retention, and deletion remain explicit privileged effects. |
| Compatibility | New contracts are additive, TypeScript-first, dependency-free, serializable, root-first, and use deterministic tests. |
| Publishing | Release work begins only after all gates pass and every version-bearing manifest agrees on `1.8.18`. |

## Evidence ledger

Every completed ten-action work package must link its evidence to the final release record: source revision or research URL, design note, code path, deterministic test name, boundary test, documentation update, validation command, result, reviewer state, and disposition. The 970 actions deliberately start with factual classification; implementation may proceed only for capabilities that are both technically feasible and expressible without false infrastructure claims.
