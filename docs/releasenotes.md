# Devthink 2.0.27

— the smoke ports of the parallel legs

### Changed

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| The smoke ports of the parallel legs | The 2.0.26 ghcr lane carried every gate further than any rung before it (the scan build, the trivy scan, the dockle scan and the contention-budgeted battery of the push build all answered green) and reddened at the last RUN of the runtime stage alone: the push resolves the five architecture legs in parallel on the one build node, and the default build network the runtime stages share let two legs bind 0.0.0.0:8080 in the same instant - the EADDRINUSE the 2.0.26 push logged (the four-architecture publishes the family once shipped never raced the window; the fifth leg the 2.0.16 index added finally widened the parallelism into it). The smoke-boot RUN rides its own loopback-only network namespace now (--network=none), so the runner binds and the probe connects inside the leg alone and no sibling leg can ever claim the port - the probe stays a pure localhost fetch, exactly the contract the healthcheck keeps, and the containerpack assertion pins the flag. |

## Distribution channels

Every artifact of this release ships through the channels below. The artifact manifest records the name, the byte size, the sha256 checksum and the channels of every artifact, the checksums file covers the release set, the sbom inventory documents it and the attestations carry its provenance. Nothing auto-publishes outside the reviewed release workflow.

### npm channel

- `wenathlan-devthink-2.0.27.tgz`

The library tarball publishes to npmjs and GitHub Packages under the `@wenathlan/devthink` scope; the same tarball attaches to the release assets.

### nuget channel

- `devthink.2.0.27.nupkg`

The nupkg carries the cli, headless and mcp entries as content files beside the umd and cjs bundles, the declaration files for ide integration, the sample fixtures and the chromium extension zip.

### maven channel

- `devthink-2.0.27.pom`
- `devthink-2.0.27.jar`
- `devthink2.0.27.zip`
- `devthink-declarations-2.0.27.zip`

The single io.github.wenathlan.devthink distribution with every consumption mode embedded as jar resources; the extension zip and the declarations zip attach with their classifiers beside the one jar.

### container channel

- `devthink-container.txt`
- `devthink-container.digest`
- `devthink-container.json`

The multi stage image publishes for the five linux architectures of the family union surface — the index answers linux/amd64, linux/arm64, linux/ppc64le, linux/s390x and linux/riscv64 beside the per platform attestation entries — with the version tag and the latest channel alias the 2.0.16 realignment carries: the version tag stays the immutable coordinate an operator pins, the latest alias moves to the version this pipeline published (the maene dist-tag doctrine the npm lanes always carried, so docker pull devthink:latest answers the current release), and no referrers fallback tag rides the package because the digest files embed the exact image hash as release assets. The node runtime arrives from the verified nodejs.org tarballs on the debian trixie slim base whose manifest carries every architecture of the index. The image exposes the mcp server, the static site and the socket relay speaking the servercontract for self hosting.

### rubygems channel

- `devthink-2.0.27.gem`

The ruby process adapter gem of devthink.gemspec builds with the runner shim the publish workflow generates at build time and pushes to the GitHub Packages RubyGems registry beside the other four package channels; the gem spawns the devthink cli without storing credentials.

### vscode channel

- `devthink-vscode-2.0.27.vsix`

The vs code package ships as a pure zip-based vsix the operator installs from the release asset with their own credentials; the manifest declares no telemetry and no network default.

### firefox channel

- `devthink-firefox-2.0.27.xpi`

The firefox build ships as the xpi artifact; the signing and notarization path per browser is documented in docs/18.browsercoverage.md.

### safari channel

- `devthink-safari-2.0.27.zip`

The safari skeleton ships as the source asset the xcode wrapper builds from.

### chromium channel

- `devthink2.0.27.zip`
- `devthink-2.0.27-source.zip`
- `devthink-nativehost-2.0.27.template.json`

The chromium extension zip, the immutable source snapshot and the native host manifest template of the release.

### site channel

- `devthink-site-2.0.27.zip`

The hashed static site of the chatbridge surface with its immutable cache header configuration.

### declarations channel

- `devthink-declarations-2.0.27.zip`

Every declaration file and declaration map of the build for ide integration; the same zip attaches to the maven channel with the declarations classifier.

### provenance channel

- `devthink-sbom-2.0.27.json`
- `devthink-attestations-2.0.27.json`
- `devthink-artifactmanifest-2.0.27.json`

The cyclonedx inventory of every artifact, the provenance attestations of the release set and the artifact manifest with names, sizes, checksums and channels.

### github channel

- `wenathlan-devthink-2.0.27.tgz`
- `devthink.2.0.27.nupkg`
- `devthink-2.0.27.pom`
- `devthink-2.0.27.jar`
- `devthink-2.0.27.gem`
- `devthink-container.txt`
- `devthink-container.digest`
- `devthink-container.json`
- `devthink-vscode-2.0.27.vsix`
- `devthink-firefox-2.0.27.xpi`
- `devthink-safari-2.0.27.zip`
- `devthink2.0.27.zip`
- `devthink-2.0.27-source.zip`
- `devthink-nativehost-2.0.27.template.json`
- `devthink-site-2.0.27.zip`
- `devthink-declarations-2.0.27.zip`
- `devthink-sbom-2.0.27.json`
- `devthink-attestations-2.0.27.json`
- `devthink-artifactmanifest-2.0.27.json`
- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `RELEASENOTES.md`

Every artifact above attaches to the release of the immutable tag beside the checksums file and these notes; the release stays a draft until the verification step downloads every asset and verifies the checksums.

- 1.1.94 — security hardening
- 1.1.93 — performance hardening
- 1.1.92 — migration tools
- 1.1.91 — api freeze

### The migration steps for upgraders

The wire speaks protocol major two since the 1.1.91 api freeze while every version one message stays accepted through the deprecation window that closes at 2.0.0 with one warning per session; upgraders from the 1.1.x line keep their storage, their sessions and their settings because the storage schemas stay frozen under the freeze artifact, the permission set stays pinned by the permission diff baseline and no data migration step is required before 2.0.0. The 2.0.0 release candidate carries the migrateplan command with the automa, selenium, ui vision and tabular importers for plans authored outside devthink.

### The frozen protocol guarantees

The 1.1.91 api freeze pins the wire: the frozen message catalog of twenty three messages with their ten schemas, the immutable action kind identifiers of the three hundred thirty five kind vocabulary, the five wire error codes beside the six terminal exit codes, the per tool versions of the mcp catalog and the seven capability manifests — every surface answers the freeze gate with the same hashes the artifact records, and a client that speaks major one keeps working through the deprecation window.

### The certified scenarios

The agent certification of the 1.1.96 release drives thirty coordination scenarios end to end over the fake tabs of every browser kind with the fake clock: the leader worker topology, the planner executor critic verifier split, the shared queue with its lanes and work stealing, the blackboard, the tab handoffs, the resource locks, the result merging, the consensus rounds, the emergency stops, the sub agent depth limits and the pool item coverage. The cost certification adds its nine budget checks and the first release candidate adds the defect sweep, the verification matrix and the telemetry free verification of this release.

### The performance budget results

The build enforces a byte budget on every dist target and fails when a bundle overgrows it; the budgets with the measured sizes of this candidate live in docs/perfbudgets.md beside the startup, latency and memory ceilings the run budget gates keep (the heartbeat window default, the task tab ceiling, the timeout ceilings and the memory budget ratio the run budget validation enforces).

### The security review summary

The security posture of the candidate: the permission set stays at its pinned baseline with the permission diff gate, the content security policy stays strict with its hashes audited, the pentest gate drives its twenty one checklist entries against the shipped bundles, the code scanning alerts of the 1.1.89 fixes stayed closed and the telemetry free verification of this release proves zero outbound requests behind the block all proxy.
